coin is ready I'm ready okay guys we're
going live we are clicking the button we
are starting the show oh yes guys oh yes
oh yes oh yes welcome to another episode
and today we'll be speaking about the
fact that this whole situation with the
ETF this whole situation with Bitcoin as
a whole by the way as an asset is just
starting out this is very important to
understand whatever we witness right now
whatever we witness up until today is
just the beginning we're only now
starting to see the TR shift in people's
mind about Bitcoin it's true shift in
the minds of Institutions about Bitcoin
and that's why Bitcoin is following our
trajectory here to 90k very very nicely
what's important to understand is that
the fugazi of the US dollar and also US
debt is now being exposed I will show
you very important chores that Balaji
showed but most importantly we are
seeing a big shift into how people think
and we're looking at a one trillion
dollar wave from institutions am amid
the current bull market according to
bitwise anyway as you know also we're
seeing all kinds of inflows in the ETF
they continue sometimes we have a day
where they're lower and the mainstream
media instantly instantly instantly
instantly start Rising oh Bitcoin ETF is
dead oh Bitcoin ETF has no inflows as
soon as we have like a day which is
slightly smaller you see them coming out
very very quickly but what happens the
next day the next day the inflows can
see you and that's what we're seeing
right now all in all new Bitcoin ETFs
now hold 500,000 Bitcoin and gbtc
outflows slow so we are seeing all kinds
of demand and this demand is just
picking up as people are seeing that
Bitcoin is the only way to check out
from the existing system from the
existing system look here I did see this
debate between Balaji and some guy where
Balaji started by posting the fact that
the US has no out of the debt so
basically this balaj posted this on
March 27th he showed that when you look
at the US debt and how much treasuries
they're issuing treasury is government
debt as you know uh it's never been this
High it is the highest since covid okay
right now they're issuing new debt as
high as much as they were in the covid
time okay at that point it was emergency
at this point there's no emergency is
just that the debt is so big you need
new debt to pay it off the debt is so
big the interest rate on that debt is so
large with the interest we have right
now they have no option but to issue new
debt as well as all of the other program
that the government has all of the free
money they're giving out all of the
other government spending they're doing
because they have no choice it's
election year obviously they're going to
spend a lot so all of this is adding up
to this situation where the US Treasury
gross issuance right now now is the
highest since Co so balaju posted this
then another guy some whipper snapper or
something he say that how you use the
word some whipper snapper comes into the
picture saying that oops you only showed
one side of the balance [ __ ] common
mistake though basically saying that the
US government has so much assets that
the debt is not relevant that the debt
which is red is so small in comparison
to the asset that it's not relevant and
so this chart you may see sometimes and
many people think when they see the
short that ah so maybe the debt is good
because you have the debt you have the
assets so everything is perfect
everything balances itself out we're in
good shape however just like Balaji
points out this these assets they're not
government assets they're your assets if
you live in the US this chart shows your
assets okay very important and that's
basically what Balaji was saying that
listen I love this so much first the
debt didn't matter okay first they said
that debt doesn't matter no one cares
about the debt no one cares about what's
happening with the treasuries that
they're issuing them so much first that
doesn't matter now it still kind of
doesn't matter because the state can
take all your assets to pay for it so
all of these assets on this so-called
balance sheet is not government assets
most of it are your assets okay it's a
balance sheet of households and
nonprofit organization okay very
important and basically Bal is saying
that kism is like communism in that it
is no real difference between household
and government assets there's no moral
limit on how much they can take from the
population via inflation and seizure
there are only practical limits so your
household assets can and will be taken
to pay for this failed state for what
this failed State owes and how much does
it owe well for that we can go to a
recent analysis on February 2024 and
there are different estimations one
estimation says that it is 37 trillion
however it is underestimated when you
include social insurance it is 78
trillion however that's also
underestimated if you look at more
broader factors you will see that it is
173 tril 75.3 trillion that the US
government owes and at some point the
fugazi will start crumbling and what
happens then they will take your assets
I mean it is always like that in a
failing currency in a failing economy
they come for your assets always always
always and listen sometimes the economy
doesn't even have to fail for them to go
and take your assets this is interesting
this is from Spain okay this is from
Spain and it's not like Spain is failing
right now I mean obviously it's not in a
luxury situation either but look here
the Spanish government is set to steal
Beach from Real Estate and let the
owners use it for 30 years so they have
some some kind of plan maybe they
reorganize how the city is done maybe
they have to change the building plan
and basically they take your property
you you have some real estate there okay
now it's now it's theirs now it's theirs
and you have to ask the state for
permission to sell or make renovation so
this is important it's theirs and they
let you live in it for 30 years that's
why real estate you understand you're
you're basically H chained to the
government whatever they want to do okay
and how do these decisions get made like
the government says they're going to
take away Apartments this is this is the
situation in Spain how does it get made
well it's some judge who is a judge it's
a it's a dude or a woman it can be a
woman also but let's for this sake
imagine it's a dude so basically you
have an asset some dude wakes up goes to
the bathroom does his business maybe
number one number two then he and
everyone does it by the way I'm just
pointing a picture for you to to show
how ridiculous it is like it's it's very
human thing obviously but we all do it
some dude wakes up takes a coffee then
he writes with a P with a pen on paper
that hey this property not yours so
basically when you don't have onchain
assets when you don't have
cryptographically secured assets the
only step between you and losing your
assets between you having asset and
losing your asset is some dude who
writes a piece of paper
this is the biggest shift that Satoshi
has invented okay this the biggest shift
that for the first time ever you don't
have this danger of some dude writing on
a piece of paper that you don't anymore
own something any gu we have a lot to
discuss as you can see we have a lot to
discuss we will be covering Bitcoin more
